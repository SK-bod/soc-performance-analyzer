# soc-performance-analyzer
soc-performance-analyzer is a FPGA module that can be used for  registration of events with their time stamp, triggered by a single write instruction to a specific space location address. It is used to measure algorithm execution time in hard processor system (HPS).  The module is written for CYCLONE V SoC, and will be tested on DE0-Nano-SoC.
